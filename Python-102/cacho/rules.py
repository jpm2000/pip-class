'''
5 players, each one starting with 5 dices guess the actual number of one number of each par the dice:

Aces = A
Ducks = 2
Trains = 3
Dogs = 4
Quinas = 5
Dinners = 6

The Aces count as any number, like a joker. To go from a number to an Ace the player needs to divide the actual count plus one, or if the player wants to go from Aces to numbers, they have to double it plus one.

If the players doubts the actual count and he or she is right, the other one loses a dice. And if the doubter is wrong, he or she loses one dice.

If the player wants to call the actual amount and gets it right, he or she gets an additional dice. But if not, he or she loses 2 dices
